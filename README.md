Assignment 6 -- Events
Sebastian Salvo

I am sorry for doing this instead of the putting it in url, I found this to be easier. I used a few event listeners such as click, mouse enter, onclick (technically not an event listener, but operates like one), wheel, and double click. Upon clicking the buttons does different effects, I made it so clicking either button changes text or gives you an alert on the page. It also displays the readme text you see here that was hidden. the mouse over even changes the text color of the yellow text in the Hello2 spot, mostly because it is harder to read. It will also make some text disappear in the red box above it with new hidden text appearing. Clicking where Hello1 is/was will solve the riddle of "Click on one" the page asks to begin with. Scrolling the wheel simply creates an alert towards the user. Lastly, double clicking the Hello3 changes the background of the block to black and creates an alert for the user. The comments of this page go into how I answered the difference between onclick vs addEventListener and the difference between innerText and innerHTML.
